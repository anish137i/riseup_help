@title = 'Phishing'

h2. What is it?

*Phishing* is when someone sends an email claiming to be an entity they are not, and uses this deception to get information. They can be after social security numbers, bank information, passwords, or other sensitive information. Emails often take the following form:

<pre>
From: help@company_or_organization.com
To: you@riseup.net

Subject: Account Alert

We need to verify your account details. Please reply to this message and enter your information the following spaces. If you do not reply, you may lose access to your account.

username: _______
password: _______
</pre>

*If you see an email like this, do NOT reply to it.*

h2. How does it affect Riseup accounts?

Riseup accounts are a frequent target. *Riseup emails will never ask for your password!* If you get an email claiming to be from Riseup, and it asks for your password in the email, *it is not from Riseup.*

If you get an email that asks you to click on a link and give your account information, it is best to manually type the address. Do not rely on the link, because the domain might be https://ríseup.net and not https://riseup.net (not the subtle difference with the accent over the i).


h2. Example phishing emails

Here are some example emails frequently sent to riseup users from *phishers* attempting to *hijack* the user's account.

This is an especially clever phishing attack. It knows that some people know Riseup will never ask them for their password in an email, so it links to a webpage that asks them for their password. The link looks like a link to riseup page, but when you click on it it actually takes you somewhere else. The webpage is cleverly designed to look almost exactly like the riseup page, in hopes that people will not notice the difference and enter their password.

To be safe, you should never click on links in emails that ask you to enter password information. Always type 'user.riseup.net' into your browser's address bar manually.

h2. Homographical attacks

This kind of spoofing uses the similarity of letters among different character sets. Homographs are similarly looking characters, e.g. between Latin and Cyrillic charsets. The international domain name (IDN) system has no restrictions in mixing letters of different charsets. Hence users are not able to differenciate between letters that are displayed in the same way.

The safest way for users is to never copy URLs from unsafe sources and always type URLs to the address bar directly (similarly to never copying code from websites to a terminal directly, but a text editor first for code auditing).

Another protection method is to deactivate IDNA in the browser. "Known since 2005":http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3481651/Firefox+Others+at+Phishing+Risk.htm this issue has been "reported to Mozilla in 2013":https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2013-61 with the consequence of restricting domain names to specific characters and using Punycode for domain names containing other characters. In firefox IDN whitelist settings can be changed browsing to @about:config@ -> *network.IDN*.
