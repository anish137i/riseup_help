%p
  Riseup is beta testing a new client called <b>RiseupVPN</b>. This VPN client is super easy to use! You just install it and run it&mdash;no configuration, no account registration.

%p
  This is an experiment to see if we can create a VPN service that is easy enough for everyone to use and that people will donate enough to sustain.

%p
  Please try it out and let us know what you think. Tell your friends!

%h2 Using RiseupVPN
