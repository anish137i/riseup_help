## Riseup users everywhere, even in your toilet

When we asked for riseup users to let us know what they're working on, we got this response from the Rhizome Collective (rhizomecollective.org): We just finished construction on the City of Austin Texas's first code approved composting toilet.

Rhizome’s new toilet sits on their 9.8 acre former Brownfield in the Montopolis neighborhood of East Austin. Composting toilets are progressive, innovative resource recovery systems that use no water and safely compost human wastes into a benign and beneficial soil amendment. The newly built composting toilet demonstrates an ideal in sustainability and the continued efforts of the Rhizome Collective to be leaders in developing appropriate technologies that are accessible to anyone.

The completion of the toilet is also a demonstration that the Rhizome Collective is still active in the wake of its having been evicted from its Eastside warehouse by the City of Austin Code Enforcement officials on March 17th, 2009.  This first step in developing infrastructure on the
Field opens the doors of possibility for the future use of the space.

## The tale of two love birds

This summer our beloved red-plumed Sunbird stood on a windy hill on the top of an island in the middle of Puget Sound and pledged his love and commitment to an amber-hued bird. All of us in the collective wish them both lives of big softness, huge hope, productive struggle, belly-deep laughter, wonder, and courage.

## Notes from the surveillance apocalypse

A company has developed artificial intelligence system that can learn to detect aberrant behavior in video. The problem with surveillance video is that there is far more of it than there are people to watch it. This new system promises to allow automation for analyzing video, removing the limitation of human labor. www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=8144

Surveillance as video game: “The online service, set to go live in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire in the UK next month, opens up access to closed-circuit cameras placed in shops, restaurants and on streets to the public, awarding cash prizes up to £1,000 each month to the users who catch the most crooks.”  http://www.psfk.com/2009/10/internet-eyes-video-surveillance-as-video-game.html

## Money pitch

Do you work at a company that does matching grants for donations to tax-exempt nonprofits? Did you know that Riseup Labs, our mad scientist laboratory where we develop secure free software, is a tax-exempt nonprofit? If you work at a company, check to see if they match donations to nonprofit organizations; if so, you can double your donation to Riseup Labs, and move money from the man to the movement. There is information about Riseup Networks and Riseup Labs at https://help.riseup.net/about-us/donate/
