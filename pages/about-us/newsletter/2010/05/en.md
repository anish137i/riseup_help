## Our lists are finally open!

It took us longer to get our list servers cleaned up, upgraded, and
ready to go into action, but the time has come where we are open again
to lists! We are thrilled to be able to provide all your great projects
with lists again. You can request them at--

https://lists.riseup.net

As always, please read through what kind of projects we do and don't
support, and our service agreement.

## Lists statistics

While we've been doing our work on the lists machine, we came up with
some statistics and numbers that you might find interesting. Sometimes,
when we are in our towns working on our specific projects, it can be
hard to get a scope of the worldwide movement. While this is by no means
even slightly comprehensive of that movement, these numbers make us
smile, and we hope you like them too.

Active Riseup Lists: 11,323
Total Subscriptions: 2,858,863
Over 950,000 messages sent a day
Unique subscribed email addresses: 1,874,698

Of these email list users, 46% do not use the "Big Four" (hotmail,
yahoo, gmail, AOL), while 54% do. For many lists this is not a big issue
-- the list is primarily for spreading information, making
announcements, etc. But for those of you who are the administrator for
lists that need more security and privacy, getting people on your list
to use riseup email or other providers that care about privacy is a good
idea. As we may have mentioned in previous emails, the big corporate
email providers aren't very good at protecting people's privacy and have
poor records of turning information over to governments.

And, of course, when you do use us, kick down some money if you can,
especially if you live in the global north. Lots of people can't, and
that's okay, but we need money to maintain & expand our services and
continue to build alternative secure communication technology.
